    Gus runs a food truck and sells hot food to hungry skaters at the local skate park. Despite all the time he spends watching other people shred, he never actually learned to skateboard. When his old friend Eduardo moves back to town, it gives Gus the motivation he needs to finally pick up a board and learn.

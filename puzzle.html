        You have all traveled a long way to join us here today. Chanele and Corin love to travel as well, and they have a puzzle for you. Your task during this cocktail hour, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out the answer to the following question.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When Chanele and Corin visit a new destination, what is the one thing they always make sure to fit into their itinerary?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To aid you in this task, you may find various clues hidden throughout the courtyard that are each marked with a star. When you think you have the answer, you can discretely let the bartender know to claim your reward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that you won't need to touch or move anything in the courtyard to find your clues, and remember to try to be discrete so as not to spoil the fun for others.
